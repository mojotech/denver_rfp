# Document Schema for Neighborhood Data
#
# Based on the inferred use-cases, we propose a document index model for storage, consumption, and
# analysis of the neighborhood data. Instead of making Neighborhood a top level bucket into which
# one might place various other types of data, it instead acts as a facet of various types of data.
#
# Elasticsearch and Kibana are excellent tools to aggregate these documents into interesting reports.
# Below is the schema that describes a portion of how we imagine this would work.
